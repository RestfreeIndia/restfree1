# Migration Summary: Vite+React to Next.js

## What's been accomplished:

1. **Project Structure Conversion**:
   - Created Next.js app directory structure
   - Migrated pages from `src/pages` to `app/[route]/page.tsx`
   - Set up appropriate Next.js configuration files

2. **Dependencies Update**:
   - Updated package.json with Next.js dependencies
   - Removed Vite-specific configurations
   - Updated scripts for Next.js commands

3. **Routing Migration**:
   - Replaced React Router with Next.js App Router
   - Created file-based routing structure
   - Added support for dynamic routes

4. **Component Updates**:
   - Added 'use client' directives to client components
   - Updated navigation to use Next.js Link and router
   - Maintained component structure for consistency

5. **Configuration Files**:
   - Created next.config.mjs
   - Updated tsconfig.json for Next.js compatibility
   - Added proper TypeScript support

## Remaining Tasks:

1. **Fix Header Component**:

   - Fix navigation with Next.js patterns

2. **Installation & Testing**:
   - Run `npm install` to update dependencies
   - Test all routes and functionality
   - Fix any runtime errors

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Set up .env file for any environment variables

4. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Test the complete authentication flow
   - Ensure user type persistence works correctly

5. **Image Optimization**:
   - Update image handling to use Next.js Image component

## Benefits of Migration:

- Improved performance with server components
- Better SEO capabilities
- Simplified routing with file-based system
- Improved developer experience
